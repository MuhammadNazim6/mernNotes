										NODE JS

Node.js® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
Open source- Source code is openly available for sharing and modification.
Cross-platform- Available for mac, windows and Linux.

JavaScript engine converts JavaScript code to a machine understanding code, that allows the computer to run specific tasks.

JavaScript runtime environment: 
	It is an environment needed for running a js code which includes JS engine, webAPIs, callback queue, microtask queue and an event loop.
	And Dependencies include libuv, v8, zlib, crypto etc

C++ is designed to carry out functionalities related to network and file systems.

REPL : Read Evaluate Print Loop 
	Can be used in terminal.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Modules: Reusable chunk of codes that have its own context.
	In Node.js each file is treated as a module.

	Local Module: The modules which are created by us in our application.
	Built in Module: The modules which are already present in the node js like fs, https etc
	Third party modules: The modules which are created by other decvelepors that we can use in our application.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Common JS is a standard that states how a module have to be structured and shared. 
Each module is wrapped with in IIFE that gives it a private scope.

A module is an IIFE which contains arguments such as module, require, __dirname, __filename, exports) that's how we can access all these by default.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
module caching:
	Module caching is a technique used in programming to improve performance by storing the results of expensive operations or computations so that they can be reused later without re-executing the operation. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

PATH:
isAbsolute : Checks if the path is absolute, means it is starting from root or not.		path.isAbsolute('c:\\Users')
resolve(): Returns a resolved absolute path by removing unnecessary symbols and /\ making it an absolute path.			
join(): joins the path given to it.
basename()
extname()
parse(): parse a given p2ath into an object containing its various components
format(): opp to parse, return a path string from an object.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

EVENTS:
const EventEmitter = require('events')
const emitter = new EventEmitter()
emitter.on() ------ emitter.emit()
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Character will be converted to a number then to a binary representation.

UTF 8 encoding suggests to represent a character in 8bytes,

Stream: Sequence of data being moved from one point to another.
	Readable stream
	Writable stream
	Duplex Stream
	Transform streams- Modify the data as it is written or read.(file compression, encryption)
buffer is a temporary memory storage for a chunk of data that is to be transferred.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Content-Type:
1. text/plain
2. text/html:
3. application/json:
4. multipart/form-data:
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Nodejs is made asynchronous using libuv.
libuv: libuv is a multi-platform, open source, c library that provides asynchronous features and functionalities to work with network requests and responses, and also for file system interactions we use libuv. It assigns task to the v8 engine.
Libuv has default 4 threads.

process.env.UV_THREADPOOL can be used to adjust the thread pool size.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Event Loop:
	It is a C program that controls the execution of the synchronous and asynchronous tasks in NodeJS.

	[ nextTick queue -> Promise queue ] -> Timer queue  -> I/O queue  -> check queue -> close queue 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

IO Polling in IO queue:
	I/O polling is a method where the event loop continuously checks for new callbacks in each queue.
It initiates the i/o queue.

setImmediate:  used to schedule a callback function to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Versioning: semVer(semantic versioning ) : Widely adopted versining systems
	major version . minor-version . patch
	if made a minor change and it is backward compatible then minor version increases.
	
if made a major change and it is not backward compatible then major version increases major version.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Cluster module:	Used to run multiple instances of Node.js that can distribute workloads among their application threads. Leads to load balancing. Runs on same port	
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

child-processes: They are the processes created by another process mainly called parent process. They are created to run multiple processes concurrently without blocking each other.
Child processes communicate with the main process through inter-process communication (IPC) channels, allowing them to exchange data and coordinate tasks.

Master is only in charge of the workers.
spawn , fork , exec , execFile can be used to create child processes.

exec and exec files are carried out using buffer while spawn is done as stream which gives more control.

exec:
 function is used to asynchronously execute shell commands from within a Node.js application. 

execFile
 Function used to execute external application or scripts with a set of arguments from your NodeJS application.

spawn
 Used to launch an external process like exec and execFile but it gives more control over the process in real time. It can be used to create any type of process.

fork
 Fork is used to create child processes that run on different instances of node js.
 It is used to create new processes of the node js instance itself.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

worker_thread modules: Used to run multiple threads in a single NodeJS instance. When there is no need of separate instances of v8, event loop and memory, we can use worker thread modules.

If the task is a time consuming task then it is moved to a new worker thread.

const {Worker} = require('worker_threads')
const worker = new Worker('file.js')

worker.on("message from file.js",(j)=>{ log message})

in the file.js we use:
 parentPort.postMessage(message,'message or variable here')

Pug and Handlebars are both popular templating engines used in web development to generate dynamic HTML content on the server-side. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Status code: Status codes are the standardized response given from the server to client to tell about the status of a client request.

1xx Informational Response:

2xx success
	200 OK
	201 created
	204 no content

3xx Redirection 

4xx Client errors
	400 Bad Request
	401 Unauthorized
	402 payment required
	403 Forbidden
	404 Not Found

5xx Server errors
	500 Internal Server error
	502 Bad geteway

Express is a popular web application framework for NodeJS

Routing : Refers to determining how a server responds to client request to a particular URL endpoint.

HTTP methods:
GET: Used to request data from the server.
POST: Used to submit data to the server from the client.
PUT: Used to update an existing data in the server entirely.
PATCH: Used to update an existing data in the server partially.
DELETE: Used to remove/ delete an existing data from the server.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

app.use: Used to mount middleware at a specific path in the middleware stack of express.
	They are also used for static file assigning.\
	Error handling
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Timer queue: They are the queue in which time dependent methods using setTimeout and setInterval are scheduled in the event loop which schedules callbacks when time delay is over. They schedule the callbacks based on the given time.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Microtask queue: It is a queue in js event loop where asynchronous tasks are queued which have a higher priority than tasks scheduled in the call back queue.
	Some eg are mutation observer and promises.
These tasks are scheduled to execute as soon as possible after the current execution in the call stack has finished.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

set Immediate(): It basically work during the next iteration of the event loop after the i/o queue. But it works before setTimeout in most cases as setTimeout has a default time of 4 ms.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

process.nextTick(): This method has the highest priority in the event loop and is executed in the next iteration of the event loop before the i/o queue and even the timer queue. It is actually asynchronous method which works immediately after the current call stack has become empty after execution.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

spawn and fork : Are both methods to create child processes , spawn- to create any new child processes while fork- for creating a new node js process or instance.
	fork has the feature for IPC (inter-process comunication) which helps to communicate with the child process and the master process.
while spawn communicates using standard input/output streams.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Buffer: Buffer is a temporary data storage area used to hold data while it's being transferred from one place to another. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Pipe : It is an readable streams method used to chain a readable stream to a writable stream to transefer data from one file to an output file.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Threadpools: Threads are used for task concurrency , but using too much threads can cause problems like overloading the cores and crashing the machine, So to prevent that we use threadpool.
	
so by using threadpool it controls or limits the number of threads created by taking in care of the number of cup's available. 
which in turn maintains concurrency over tasks by using the hardware's capacity to the fullest without overwhelming cores.

It helps for reusing thread after a thread has been used it can be reused again for other tasks.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Synchronous tasks are handled in the main thread, while async in event loop, using libuv and threadpool.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Libuv controls [ event loop , main thread for async , thread pools for blocking ] 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Event driven programming: It is a programming paradigm where flow of the program is determined by multiple number of events that works asynchronously.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

API versioning : Process of managing different versions of API's which maintains backward compatibility.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Rate limiting : To limit the rate of http requests to a server, which helps to reduce the server load due to multiple requests.
Debouncing: It restricts the number of frequent triggering of events and functions , by triggering only when the difference between two event triggering is a certain time.

Throttling: It restricts a new event or function call after the current event is triggered, for a specified limit of time. All other event calls between these time is ignored.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Accept :> http header that a client includes in their request header to specify what all are content types they accept as response.
	eg:- Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

content-negotiation: The server looks up the clients specification on the response data types and their capabilities to give a proper response to the client.
	Client-driven content negotiation: This allows the client to control the type of content it receives.
	Server-driven content negotiation: This allows the server to control the type of content it sends.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

process and thread: Each process has its own thread.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Design patterns: They are the different methods to represent a programmes code which enables a structure, standard, scalability and code readability.
	Most common are: Module Pattern, repository pattern, observer pattern , middleware pattern etc.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Static folder:
	Directory that contains static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, and other files that are served directly to clients without any processing or modification by the server.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

environment variables: contains configuration settings specific to the environment in which the application is running like port number, database connections strings and other private keys and dynamic values which are needed during the runtime.
require('dotenv').config();
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

error first callback: This convention specifies that the first argument passed to a callback function should be reserved for an error object, if an error occurs during the 	asynchronous operation.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Res.write(): Used to send text type data from the server to the client as a response to a request.
Res.end(): It is used to specify the end of a response send to a client.

Res.send() : It is used to send a response to the client containing various type of data without mentioning explicitly.
	It is a higer level method provided by express.js.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system or resource.
It confirms that the user is who they claim to be by validating their credentials, such as username/password, etc.

Authorization:
Authorization, also known as access control, is the process of determining what actions or resources a user or entity is permitted to access or perform within a system or application.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Middleware: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 

Types of middleware:
1.Error handling middleware  (err, req, res, next)):

2.Application level middleware	  MIddlewares taking place in each req res. Like authentication middleware

3.Router level middleware	app.use("/", user_route);

4.Built-in middleware	app.use(express.json());     app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}));     app.use(express.static('public'));

5.Third-party middleware	app.use(morgan())
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

app.all:  It allows you to define middleware that should run regardless of the HTTP method used in the request.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Process manager: It is used to run multiple process instances at a time concurrently.
	process management, load balancing, logging, monitoring, and more.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

CORS: If two webapps having two different origins then they need to follow CORS mechanism.
1. preflight call (options call)
2. Origin-2 verifies the preflight call
3. If valid it will send some http headers to Origin-1
4. Then actual call to Origin-2

const cors = require('cors')
app.use(cors({origin:['www.google.com'],method:['GET']} )
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

payload : Any data transferred over a network is called payload.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

CSRF: Cross site resource forgery
	It is a security vulnerability for the users using internet applications which are misused by hackers to send false requests from the users webapp to the official server. Where the server thinks the request is from the authorised user.

It is prevented by implementing csrf tokens, which are send as a response from the server through each response. And then the next request should contain this CSRF token or else the request will be considered as a CSRF threat.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

HTTP Request:
